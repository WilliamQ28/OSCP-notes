A word of caution

by downloading and running public exploits we can greatly endanger a system or environment

Online Exploit Resources

The exploit Database

Exploit-DB

D field is a quick way we can download the exploit file
A field lists the vulnerabile application files
V field marks if it has been verified
Title field will give a name with respective version
Type field designates: dos, local, reomate or webapp
Platform designates system are affected, can be os, hardware, or even PHP
Author field is author


Packet Storm

information security website that has up-to-date information on news, exploits and tools

GitHub

using exploits from github presents a large security risk and caution is advised

offsec has a github account where we can find different repo likee exploitdb-bin-sploits

Google Search Operators

search using specific software version followed by exploit

firefox --search "Microsoft Edge site:exploit-db.com"
can be run in kali cmd
note the site: operator and "" string specfific in body operator

Offline Exploit Resource

Exploit Frameworks

Metaspliot
Core Imapct no free version, automate testing, link to vulnerability scanners, complete phishing campaigns and re-test exploit systems to verify remediation
Canvas paid, exploits are updated every month
Browser Exploitation Framework: pentest tool client attack focused with browser


SearchSploit
Exploit database provides a downloadable archived copy of all the hosted exploit code

inclided by default but make sure to update before any assessment

ls -1 /usr/share/exploitdb/

ls -1 /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits
sub directories are seprarted based on operating system, architecture, scripting language

we can run
searchsploit
to display parameters

searchsploit remote smb microsoft windows
we can search for all available remote exploits that target the SMB service on the Windows operating system

note that exploitdb needs to be updated not searchsploit

-m allows for copying of exploit to current working directory


Nmap NSE Scripts

most popular tool for enumeration

complete list of scripts provided by NSE can be found under
/usr/share/nmap/scripts
we can use grep to search for words

for example:
grep Exploits /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*.nse

we can display info of the NSE script by running --script-help

for example:
nmap --script-help=clamav-esec.nse


Putiting it together

scan the target for open ports
gobuster
we can also check source code for web app version
with the version we search expliotdb 

sudo apt update && sudo apt install exploitdb
update exploitdb
