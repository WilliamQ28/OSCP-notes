# 📂 Locating Public Exploits

## ⚠️ A Word of Caution

Downloading and running public exploits can pose a serious risk to systems and environments. Always analyze and test in isolated, controlled environments.

## 🌐 Online Exploit Resources

### 🔎 Exploit Database (Exploit-DB)

- **D**: Download the exploit file
- **A**: Affected application
- **V**: Verified status of exploit
- **Title**: Name and version of the vulnerability
- **Type**: Exploit category (DoS, local, remote, webapp)
- **Platform**: Affected system (OS, hardware, PHP, etc.)
- **Author**: Exploit author

---

### 🌩 Packet Storm

A reliable information security website with up-to-date news, exploits, and tools.

---

### 🧪 GitHub

- Be cautious: Many exploits on GitHub are unverified and potentially harmful.
- OffSec maintains a GitHub presence, including repositories like:
  - `exploitdb-bin-sploits`

---

### 🔍 Google Search Operators

Use search operators to locate specific exploits. Example:
```bash
firefox --search "Microsoft Edge site:exploit-db.com"
```

Note:
- `site:` scopes the domain
- Quoted strings ensure specificity

This can also be run in the Kali terminal.

## 💾 Offline Exploit Resources

### 🛠 Exploit Frameworks

- **Metasploit**: Most popular free exploitation framework.
- **Core Impact** (Paid): Automates testing, integrates with vulnerability scanners, supports phishing campaigns, and verifies patch effectiveness.
- **Canvas** (Paid): Updated monthly with new exploits.
- **Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF)**: Browser-based client-side exploitation tool for penetration testing.

### 🔍 SearchSploit

A local, offline copy of the Exploit-DB.

- Default installation location:
  ```bash
  ls -1 /usr/share/exploitdb/
  ls -1 /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/
  ```
- Exploits are organized by OS, architecture, or language.
- Basic usage:
  ```bash
  searchsploit remote smb microsoft windows
  ```
- To copy an exploit:
  ```bash
  searchsploit -m <exploit_name>
  ```

🔄 **Note**: You must update `exploitdb`, not just `searchsploit`.

Update:
```bash
searchsploit -u
```

---

### 🧠 Nmap NSE Scripts

- Enumeration-focused
- Script directory:
  ```bash
  /usr/share/nmap/scripts/
  ```
- To search scripts:
  ```bash
  grep Exploits /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*.nse
  ```
- To display script help:
  ```bash
  nmap --script-help=<script-name>
  ```

Example:
```bash
nmap --script-help=clamav-esec.nse
```

## 🧩 Putting It All Together

1. Scan the target for open ports (e.g., `nmap`)
2. Use `gobuster` or review source code for version info
3. Identify the software version
4. Search Exploit-DB:
   ```bash
   searchsploit <service> <version>
   ```
5. Install and update Exploit-DB:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install exploitdb
   searchsploit -u
   ```
